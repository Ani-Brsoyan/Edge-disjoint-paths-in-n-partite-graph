The Problem Of Finding Maximum Edge-Disjoint Paths In N-partite Graph

This program is written in C++ in the Qt framework. 

As an input, it takes an example.txt file, where there is given an n-partite graph with corresponding syntax.
The first N lines are vertices: each line is a distinct subset of vertices in the graph.
The next N-1 lines are edges: each line is a subset of edges between two sets of vertices.
NOTE: We consider a specific type of N-partite graph where (u, v) is an edge, s. t. u and v belong to consecutive subsets

After adding all the attached files in the Qt environment click on the run button.
The main window will appear on your screen with the already painted N-partite graph given in example.txt.
On the bottom left corner of the main window, there is a green button "Find paths".
Once you've clicked on the button, the maximum edge-disjoint paths will be painted red.
